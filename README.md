# Memory Matching Game

A fun and interactive memory matching game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game gets progressively harder with increasing levels, features a scoring system, and challenges players to beat the timer.

## Features

- **Dynamic Levels:** Difficulty increases as you progress.
- **Scoring System:** Earn points for every matching pair.
- **Timer:** Beat the clock to complete each level.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on various screen sizes.
- **Restart Option:** Reset and start over anytime.

## How to Play

1. Flip two cards to reveal their symbols.
2. If the cards match, they remain flipped, and you earn points.
3. If the cards don’t match, they flip back over.

5. Progress to higher levels with more cards and less time.
